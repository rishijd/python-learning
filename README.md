# python-learning
Scripts that I find are useful while I learn Python (coming from a PHP background)

I am currently learning: Python for data science (using Anaconda and certain libraries associated with it). 

I recently learnt:
* Web scraping with Python (we scraped Amazon.com products and a basic PDF)
* Python general programming (ongoing) to ensure I understand the language and powerful data structures associated with it, which is one of the major differences from PHP that I have learnt so far.

Background on me:

I am a full stack software engineer and technical lead. Built a custom PHP/PostgreSQL e-commerce site for a UK footwear retailer back in 2004, that grew to a multi-region / multilingual ‘high medium’ business, for a strong and rewarding client relationship of over 11 years. This paved the way to hiring, training and managing a 10-person engineering team, working as small project-centric teams.
